## Question: Across the United States, 
## how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources changed from 1999â€“2008?

# Answer1: Comm/Institutional and Electrical Generation emissions has a increase from 2002 to 2005.
# Answer2: Industrial Boiler has a increase by emissions from 1999 to 2002 and a decrease from 2002 to 2008.
