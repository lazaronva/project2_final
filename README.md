# The project
## Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is an ambient air pollutant for which there is strong evidence that it is
# harmful to human health. 
## In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is tasked with
#setting national ambient air quality standards for fine PM and for tracking the emissions of this pollutant into
#the atmosphere. 
## Approximatly every 3 years, the EPA releases its database on emissions of PM2.5. This
# database is known as the National Emissions Inventory (NEI). 
#
## Six questions was made:
1. Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008? Using the base
plotting system, make a plot showing the total PM2.5 emission from all sources for each of the years
1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.
2. Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the Baltimore City, Maryland ( fips == "24510" ) from
1999 to 2008? Use the base plotting system to make a plot answering this question.
3. Of the four types of sources indicated by the type (point, nonpoint, onroad, nonroad) variable, which
of these four sources have seen decreases in emissions from 1999–2008 for Baltimore City? Which
have seen increases in emissions from 1999–2008? Use the ggplot2 plotting system to make a plot
answer this question.
4. Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources changed from
1999–2008?
5. How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999–2008 in Baltimore City?
6. Compare emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore City with emissions from motor vehicle
sources in Los Angeles County, California ( fips == "06037" ). Which city has seen greater changes
over time in motor vehicle emissions?
